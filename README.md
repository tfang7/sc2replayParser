# sc2replayParser
Python script for reading multiple sc2replay files
This is a good start for gathering data from sc2 replay files.

Current functions
1. saves all players from replay set into dictionary
2. includes win/loss
3. all player matchup history
4. average time spent in games
5. writes a csv file in Source,Target format to represent player match ups as nodes/edges.

Thanks to Kevin @ http://lotv.spawningtool.com/build/ for supplying me with replays in order to test this script.

Good luck,
 Tommy
